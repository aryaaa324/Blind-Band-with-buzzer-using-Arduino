A Blind Band is one such technology that has been developed to help people with visual impairments navigate their surroundings and improve their overall mobility and independence
The Blind Band with Buzzer is a low-cost, portable, and easy-to-use device that provides an alternative to expensive assistive technology products currently available in the market.
It is designed to detect obstacles and provide an audible warning signal to the user. The device consists of ultrasonic sensors that detect objects within a specific range and feed the information back to the Arduino board. The board then processes the data and triggers the buzzer to emit a sound that gets louder as the user approaches the obstacle. 
The design process includes selecting the appropriate components, building the circuit, and programming the Arduino board. We also evaluate the performance of the device in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and reliability in detecting obstacles.
Components:
 1. Arduino board - It is the main component that controls the entire circuit and program.
2. Ultrasonic sensor - It is used to detect obstacles and measure the distance of objects from the blind stick.
3. Buzzer - It produces sound signals when an obstacle is detected or to alert the user about any danger.
4. Battery - It powers the entire circuit and device
5. LED indicators - These indicate the status of the device such as power on/off, obstacle detection, etc
9. Jumper wires - These are used to connect various components on the breadboard.
10. Enclosure - It is used to protect the circuit and device.
